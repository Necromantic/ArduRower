# ArduRower
The project was created on the basis of the ESP32 board (Heletec WiFi Kit 32 - cheap ESP32 board with OLED & LiPo battery interface) for equipping chinese clones of waterrover like Incline/XtremepowerUS (or DIY rowing machines) with a tiny OLED screen and bluetooth interface. The device have emulates the work of the original waterrover S4 equipped with a bluetooth comm module. Tested work with the Coxswain and Kinomap app, which allows to record and export your workouts to garmin connect and/or strava. To connect to your rowing machine, you only need to attach two GND and GPIO2 wires to the RPM sensor (you can add 1kÎ© resistor or similar on each wire for protection ESP32 board). You can also connect the battery to GPIO33 through a divider of two resistors: 220k resistance connects to + of LiPo battery and GPIO33, 33k resistance to GND and GPIO33
